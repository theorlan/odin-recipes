            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of
                black
                pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you
                want to
                make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>

            <h2>What Is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>

            <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce
                comes
                from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot
                enough
                to
                cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>
