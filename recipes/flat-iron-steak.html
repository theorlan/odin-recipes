            <p>This delicious flat iron steak was created from a combination of different recipes that I read. I combined,
                adjusted, and finally perfected the marinade and cooking time to my taste. I'm sure you will love it as well.
                After all, it is perfection!</p>
        
            <h2>What Is Flat Iron Steak?</h2>
            <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to
                separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.</p>
            <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among
                home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>
        
            <h2>Flat Iron Steak Marinade</h2>
            <p>This simple flat iron steak marinade (made with olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt,
                pepper and mustard powder) ensures flavorful and juicy meat every time. Make sure you marinate the steaks in the
                fridge for at least a few hours to reap the full benefits of the marinade.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
                <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
                <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine,
                    salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the
                    refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes
                    on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted
                    into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
                <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
